The screenshot above shows that he has blocked access to his web site from outside Thailand. Bizarrely the reason given for this is that "Geographic restrictions are part of our ongoing commitment to secure and protect your privacy and data." Why does he need to hide his web site from scrutiny from abroad? How on earth does access to this web site outside Thailand and access to information about the services that are provided by this Therapy Help Center endanger the privacy of his clients?

What he has done is disallowed access to information about what HIS practice is doing in Thailand, there is no information about clients on his web site. The only thing that he can be protecting against is people who live outside the country where he is operating seeing information about his practise. Within Thailand he is sheltered from criticism to some degree, because of Thailand's harsh anti-defamatory laws that make defamation a criminal rather than a civil offence and against which telling the truth is not a defence.
