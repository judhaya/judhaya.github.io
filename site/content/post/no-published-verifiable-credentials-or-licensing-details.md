title: No Published Verifiable Credentials or Licensing Details

description: Although the Therapy Help Center, or the therapist there, claims to
  be a member of the APA, it is important to note that anyone can be a member of
  the APA, any member of the public just needs to pay the dues of the
  organisation to be a member.

We can conclude from the fact that no licensing information is shown on the web site that the centre is unlicensed.

Indeed we might question if the therapist does have an MSCP as claimed. Nowhere [on the web site of the center](https://www.therapyhelpcenter.com/meetthedirector/) or on the [web site of the therapist](https://williamkannberg.com/) is there any mention of where the MSCP was obtained from.

The only credential presented is a link to [a very poorly written thesis published on the Google Play store which is for sale for $9.99!](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vA84AgAAQBAJ) This is linked to from the therapist's web site as "Research Links". We can conclude that the study is so poor quality that it is not publishable in a peer-reviewed journal of any sort. A preview of the study is [available on Google books](https://books.google.com/books?id=vA84AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) for those who would like to take a look.
