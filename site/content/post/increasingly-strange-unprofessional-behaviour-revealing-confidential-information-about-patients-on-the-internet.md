[Repeated complaints against the therapist](https://goo.gl/maps/DMESwTy6otcB52888) include among other things:

* over medication and inappropriate involvement of this psychologist in diagnoses and perscription of drugs.
* not listening to legitimate concerns of the patients about their drug regimens.
* sudden summary dismissals without any reasons given when clients deteriorate as a result of overtreatment and start to have serious questions about the therapist.

In order to discount complaints made against his centre, the therapist at Therapy Help Center is now making very questionable accusations of the people complaining. It is never OK to reveal personal confidential information about a patient online. This fits into the pattern of very unprofessional behaviour that is coming to light about this therapist.
