blurb:
  heading: Please Be Warned
  text: Numerous clients of the unlicensed Therapy Help Center operating from Mu
    Ban Ing Doi have reported very bad outcomes resulting from their work with
    the therapist there.
intro:
  heading: Over-Diagnosis Over-Prescription
  text: Although the therapist here is in no way qualified to make psychiatric
    diagnoses or indeed to prescribe drugs he works closely with a psychiatrist.
    Heartbreakingly, many people who have gone to this therapy centre for help
    with relatively minor complaints have come away with inappropriate very
    serious diagnoses and very strong drugs.

    text: Many people have found the therapist here very understanding, persuasive
      and even helpful at first, but have found the help he has given has been
      undone by very frequent over-treatment of non-existent conditions.

    text: Wishing everyone the best of health. If you have doubts about the
      treatment you have received at the Therapy Help Center or are thinking
      about seeing the therapist there we urge you to talk to other therapists
      first. Perhaps one in Chiang Mai or in another area. You will find that
      lots of therapists in Chiang Mai have dealt with the fall out from this
      center and are willing and/or able to talk about it to varying degrees.
      You can also get in touch with us through the contact link above. We are a
      group of ex-clients who have felt very badly served by this centre.
      Unfortunately, it seems that more and more mistreatment is coming to light
      all the time. Best wishes!!
